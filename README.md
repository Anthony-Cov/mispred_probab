preprint</A>)

<P align=justify>In this research we intended to come closer to understanding of time series intrinsic predictability. 
Numerous experiments with various forecasting models show that the main difference between the series of good and 
bad predictability lies in the area of statistics and probabilities of misprediction. It is an obvious fact which 
is rarely mentioned in the papers dealing with forecasting and predictability. Almost like a bad shooter is not 
the one who misses every time but the one whose probability of missing is significantly greater than that of a good 
shooter. So, our aim is to find a way to quantify internal predictability using time series features. And it's 
desirable this measure to be simply understandable and explainable, like the probability of miss in the analogy 
with shooting.</P>
